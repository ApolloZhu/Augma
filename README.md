# Augma

This is an ambitious project that implements Augma, an imaginary device depicted in [*Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale*](http://sao-movie.net/us/) which integrates augmented reality into everyday life activities. There already exists such devices like [Google Glass](https://www.x.company/glass/) and Microsoft [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), however too expensive for normal customers. The goal of this project is to achieve similar functionalities as a software running on ARKit compatible iPhones (iOS 11, A9 or later processor) alone, without the help of any external sensors.
